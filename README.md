A key skill every programmer should have is problem solving (algorithms, paradigms, data structures, etc.), and Codewars is a very good platform to practice this hability because of its structure: support of multiple programming languages, user rank system, easily (with moderation) code challenge creation system and social interaction between users (similar code-challenges, comments, votes, and more).

By having a folder that contains all the code challenges i have completed, i can keep a personal registry of all my katas in a more readable way :)
